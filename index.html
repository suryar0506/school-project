    <p class="para"><b>The 6-day war,as the name implies, lasted 6 days. It was fought over the newly created state of Israel. Israel was created by the UN in order to serve as a safe haven for holocaust refugees. In the Holocaust, Jews were targeted just because they practiced Judaism. Around 6 million were massacred. Then, due to the UN feeling guilty, they sanctioned what was then Palestine into both Israel, and Palestine. The Arabs already living in Palestine did not like this. Hence, they and the surrounding countries decided to attack Israel. Israel put up a great fight, and also won.Israel also gained quite a bit of land from the war. The religious significance of the 6-day war, was that the Western wall, Jerusalem and other such places were "redeemed".This increased the Jews' faith, and rejected the Roman cry of "Jerusalem is lost!".</b></p>
